Using Machine learning algorithm on the famous Titanic Disaster Dataset for Predicting the survival of the passenger

Skills:

    Python3
    Numpy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Machine Learning Algorithm
    Classification Algorithms
    Random Forest
    
This Notebook shows:

    Data Handling
    Importing Data with Pandas
    Cleaning Data
    Data Visualisation

## Data Analysis:

Supervised Machine learning Techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, K-nearest neighbours, Neural Network.

Only 3 models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) out of 6 models provide 100% accuracy (i.e. 1.0)

So, I used the Random Forest Classifier to predict all the survivors correctly.

P.S.: If you find this helpful, kindly consider giving it a star rating. Thank you!
